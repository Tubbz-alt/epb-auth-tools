# EPB Authentication and Authorisation Tools

This RubyGem provides a set of tools to use along with [communitiesuk/epb-auth-server](https://github.com/communitiesuk/epb-auth-server).
There are two primary components: middleware for validating JWTs in sinatra apps,
and a HTTP client that provides a mechanism for making authenticated requests.

## Getting set up

### Testing

### Syntax Cleanup

`make format`.
